# 🏥 **Disease Prediction System** 

## 📌 **Overview**

The **Disease Prediction System** is a **machine learning-powered** web application designed to predict the likelihood of three critical diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease. The application features an intuitive Streamlit interface, enabling users to input key health parameters and receive accurate, data-driven predictions generated by **pre-trained machine learning models.**

> This system is built with a strong focus on usability, accuracy, and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for early disease detection and health risk assessment.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

✅ **Multi-Disease Prediction** – Accurately predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease based on user inputs.

✅ **Intuitive Web Interfac** – Designed using Streamlit for a seamless and user-friendly experience.

✅ **Robust Machine Learning Models** – Uses pre-trained models built with Scikit-learn, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.

✅ **Real-World Datasets** – Trained on well-structured and relevant medical datasets.

✅ **Fast & Efficient** – Provides predictions in real-time with optimized performance.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

🔹 **Python** – Core programming language for model development
🔹 **Streamlit** – Used for building the interactive web application
🔹 **Scikit-learn** – Provides machine learning algorithms for training and predictions
🔹 **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing and numerical computations
🔹 **Pickle** – Model serialization and storage


## 🔧 **Installation & Setup**

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

```bash
# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/DevPatel1010/disease-outbreaks-prediction.git
cd disease-outbreaks-prediction

# Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Application
streamlit run web.py
```

**Interact with the System:**
🔹Enter the required health parameters in the Streamlit UI
🔹The system will process the inputs using pre-trained models
🔹Predictions will be displayed instantly

## 📊 **How It Works**

1️⃣ **User Input** – Users provide relevant health details (e.g., blood pressure, glucose level, etc.).

2️⃣ **Model Processing** – The pre-trained machine learning models analyze the input.

3️⃣ **Prediction Output** – The application displays whether the user is at risk for Diabetes, Heart Disease, or Parkinson’s Disease.
